Questions for
JavaScript !!!
@Aakash Kanojiya
What is JavaScript and how is it used in web
development?
@Aakash Kanojiya
JavaScript is a programming language used to create
interactive effects within web browsers. It can be used for
front-end development to create interactive user interfaces,
and also for back-end development to create server-side
applications. JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
used in web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
What is the difference between JavaScript and other
programming languages?
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed, high-level programming
language that is used mainly for front-end and back-end web
development. It is unique in that it is executed on the clientside,
meaning that it runs within a web browser. Other
programming languages may be compiled or interpreted and
can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as desktop
or mobile applications.
What is the Document Object Model (DOM) in
JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming
interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the
page so that programs can change the document structure,
style, and content. The DOM provides a way for programmers
to access and manipulate HTML and XML documents, which
makes it essential for building dynamic web pages and
applications.
What are the different data types in JavaScript?
JavaScript has seven different data types: undefined, null,
boolean, number, string, object, and symbol.
How do you declare variables in JavaScript?
Variables can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords
in JavaScript. The var keyword is used for declaring variables
with global or functional scope, while let and const are used
for block-scoped variables.
What is hoisting in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and
function declarations are moved to the top of their respective
scopes. This means that a variable or function can be used
before it has been declared, although it will still be undefined
until it is assigned a value.
What is scope in JavaScript?
Scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions, and
objects in different parts of a JavaScript program. There are
two types of scope in JavaScript: global scope and local scope.
What are closures in JavaScript?
Closures are functions that have access to variables in their
outer (enclosing) functions, even after the outer function has
returned. This is possible because the inner function retains a
reference to the variables in the outer function, which are kept
alive in memory.
What is the difference between an object and an array
in JavaScript?
An object is a collection of properties, where each property is
a key-value pair. An array is an ordered list of values, where
each value is accessed by its index number.
How do you create an object in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
Objects can be created using object literals or using the Object
constructor function. For example, an object can be created
using an object literal like this:
What is prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?
Prototypal inheritance is a way of creating new objects based
on existing objects, by inheriting their properties and
methods. In JavaScript, every object has a prototype, which is a
reference to another object that it inherits properties and
methods from.
What is the difference between synchronous and
asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
Synchronous programming is when tasks are executed
sequentially, one after the other, in a predictable order.
Asynchronous programming is when tasks are executed
concurrently, and the order of execution is not guaranteed.
What is a promise in JavaScript?
A promise is a JavaScript object that represents a value that
may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future.
What is async/await in JavaScript?
Async/await is a way to write asynchronous code that looks
like synchronous code. It allows developers to write code that
waits for a promise to resolve before executing the next line of
code.
What are the different types of operators in JavaScript?
JavaScript has several types of operators, including arithmetic,
assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, and string operators.
What is the difference between == and === in
JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
The == operator compares values for equality, whereas the
=== operator compares values for equality and type.
What is event bubbling in JavaScript?
Event bubbling is the process by which an event propagates
from the innermost element that triggered the event up to the
document root, triggering all event handlers along the way.
What is event delegation in JavaScript?
Event delegation is a technique in which a single event
handler is added to a parent element, rather than multiple
event handlers being added to multiple child elements.
What is a decorator in JavaScript?
A decorator in JavaScript is a function that is used to modify
the behavior of another function or object. Decorators are
typically used to add functionality to an existing function or
object without modifying its original source code.
What is the difference between onclick and
addEventListener in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
The main difference between onclick and addEventListener in
JavaScript is how they handle multiple event listeners for the
same element.
onclick is an inline event handler attribute that can be added
to an HTML element to execute a JavaScript function when the
element is clicked. It can only handle a single function at a
time, which means that if multiple onclick attributes are
added to the same element, only the last one will be executed.
Also, it cannot be removed once it is set.
On the other hand, addEventListener is a method that allows
you to attach multiple event listeners to an element. It can
handle multiple functions at the same time and the order in
which they are added is preserved. Also, it allows you to
remove a specific listener from the element using the
removeEventListener method.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data
interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write
and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text
format that is used to represent data in a structured way and
is widely used for data exchange between web servers and
clients.
In JavaScript, JSON is used to exchange data between a web
server and a web application. The JSON format is based on a
subset of the JavaScript programming language and is natively
supported by most modern web browsers.
What is JSON and how is it used in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in
web development to exchange data with a web server
asynchronously, without the need to reload the entire page. It
allows web applications to update parts of a web page without
refreshing the entire page, providing a smoother and more
responsive user experience.
In JavaScript, AJAX is typically implemented using the
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, which allows you to send HTTP
requests to a server and receive responses in different formats,
such as HTML, XML, JSON, or plain text.
Here's an example of how to use the XHR object to send an HTTP
GET request to a web server and receive a JSON response:

What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
Syntax errors: These occur when the syntax of a program
is incorrect and prevent the program from running.
Syntax errors are usually caused by typographical errors,
missing brackets, or invalid statements. For example,
forgetting to close a bracket or using an incorrect
operator can cause a syntax error.
Runtime errors: These occur during the execution of a
program and can cause it to crash or behave
unexpectedly. Runtime errors are usually caused by
invalid data or unexpected conditions, such as dividing a
number by zero or trying to access a non-existent object
property.
Logical errors: These occur when a program runs without
crashing but produces incorrect or unexpected results.
Logical errors are usually caused by errors in the
program's algorithm or logic, such as using the wrong
formula for a calculation or not handling a specific
condition.

What is try-catch in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
try-catch is a JavaScript statement that allows you to handle
exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. The
try block contains the code that might throw an exception,
while the catch block handles the exception by executing a set
of statements.
Here's an example:
What is the difference between null and undefined in
JavaScript?
null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any
object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no
value assigned to it. undefined, on the other hand, is a value
that represents an uninitialized variable or a missing property
in an object.
What is the event loop in JavaScript?
@Aakash Kanojiya
The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows for
asynchronous programming. It continuously monitors the call
stack and the message queue, and when the call stack is
empty, it takes the first message from the queue and adds it to
the call stack.
