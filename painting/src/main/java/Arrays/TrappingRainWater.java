// Trapping rain water problem overview

/*
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1. Compute how much water it can trap after raining!

Here the elevation map (the input for the algorithm) is [4,1,3,1,5] and the output is the total units of trapped rain water - which is 7.
